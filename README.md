# Grasp Quality Dataset Generator for Bin Picking

## Overview

This project is a Python-based tool integrated with Blender that generates synthetic datasets for bin-picking tasks. It uses Blender's physics engine and various simulation settings to create scenes where objects are placed in bins, and a grasp quality (GQ) map is generated for each scene.

The dataset includes RGB images, depth maps, normal vectors, and segmentation masks, with an additional Grasp Quality map that measures the suitability of each pixel for grasping.

This tool is primarily aimed at researchers or engineers working on robotic grasping tasks and machine learning models for bin-picking.
